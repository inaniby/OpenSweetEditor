# SweetEditor Apple SDK

This directory is the Apple SPM workspace root.

## Published products

- `SweetEditoriOS`
- `SweetEditorMacOS`

`SweetEditorCore` is an internal target and is not published as a product.

## Local commands

- `make all` runs native prebuild + `swift build` + `swift test`
- `make native` builds `binaries/SweetEditorCoreIOS.xcframework` and `binaries/SweetEditorCoreOSX.xcframework`
- `make native-if-needed` only rebuilds native when inputs changed
- `make build` builds SPM targets
- `make test` runs SPM tests
- `make verify-local` checks manifest and builds
- `make demo-macos-build` builds the macOS demo apps
- `make demo-macos-run` runs the AppKit macOS demo app
- `make demo-macos-run-swiftui` runs the SwiftUI macOS demo app

## Native artifact layout

- `platform/Apple/binaries/SweetEditorCoreIOS.xcframework` and `platform/Apple/binaries/SweetEditorCoreOSX.xcframework` are the packaged binary artifacts consumed by `Package.swift`.
- The XCFrameworks contain dynamic `SweetEditorCore.framework` slices for macOS, iOS device (`arm64`), and iOS simulator (`arm64`).
- Intermediate build outputs remain under `build/apple-*`. Those build directories may contain the underlying dynamic-library binaries used by the framework bundles, but only the XCFramework in `binaries/` is treated as a stable distributable artifact.

### Consumer note

The package surface stays the same, but the native Apple payload is now delivered as dynamic frameworks inside the XCFramework. App consumers should continue integrating through Swift Package Manager rather than trying to reference intermediate build outputs directly.

## Xcode one-click setup

1. Open `platform/Apple/Package.swift` in Xcode.
2. Edit active Scheme -> Build -> Pre-actions.
3. Add script:

```bash
cd "$SRCROOT"
./scripts/xcode_prebuild.sh
```

Optional: force native rebuild once by setting env var in pre-action:

```bash
export SWEETEDITOR_FORCE_NATIVE=1
```

## Fold toggle callback

Apple views now expose a fold toggle callback for both gutter-arrow clicks and folded-placeholder clicks.

- Event type: `SweetEditorFoldToggleEvent`
- Fields: `line`, `isGutter`, `locationInView`
- `line` is 0-based logical line index

### macOS AppKit

```swift
let editor = SweetEditorViewMacOS(frame: .zero)
editor.showsPerformanceOverlay = true
editor.onFoldToggle = { event in
    print("fold toggled at line: \(event.line), gutter: \(event.isGutter)")
}
```

### iOS UIKit

```swift
let editor = SweetEditorViewiOS(frame: .zero)
editor.onFoldToggle = { event in
    print("fold toggled at line: \(event.line), gutter: \(event.isGutter)")
}
```

### SwiftUI

```swift
SweetEditorSwiftUIMacOS(
    isDarkTheme: false,
    showsPerformanceOverlay: true,
    onFoldToggle: { event in
        print(event.line)
    }
)

SweetEditorSwiftUIViewiOS(
    isDarkTheme: false,
    onFoldToggle: { event in
        print(event.line)
    }
)
```

## Runtime settings

Use `settings` as the preferred entry point for runtime editor configuration. This matches the Android-side design where runtime behavior is centralized in `EditorSettings`, while theme and language configuration stay on their own APIs.

### macOS AppKit

```swift
let editor = SweetEditorViewMacOS(frame: .zero)
editor.settings.setScale(1.1)
editor.settings.setWrapMode(.wordBreak)
editor.settings.setLineSpacing(add: 1.0, mult: 1.2)
editor.settings.setReadOnly(false)
editor.settings.setMaxGutterIcons(2)

editor.applyTheme(.dark())
editor.setLanguageConfiguration(swiftConfig)
```

### iOS UIKit

```swift
let editor = SweetEditorViewiOS(frame: .zero)
editor.settings.setScale(1.1)
editor.settings.setWrapMode(.wordBreak)
editor.settings.setLineSpacing(add: 1.0, mult: 1.2)
editor.settings.setReadOnly(false)
editor.settings.setMaxGutterIcons(2)

editor.applyTheme(.dark())
editor.setLanguageConfiguration(swiftConfig)
```

### Compatibility note

Legacy setters such as `setScale(_:)`, `setWrapMode(_:)`, and `setReadOnly(_:)` remain available for compatibility, but they now forward into `settings`. Prefer `settings` for new integration code.
